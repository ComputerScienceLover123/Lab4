''' This work session, I am mainly focusing on re structuring my problem 3 code, and continuing on with the following project euler problems '''

#define number that needs to be prime factored
n = 600851475143
#kind of like a counter, starting off with the first prime factor.
primeFact = 1
#mainly used to test if certain numbers are in fact prime
x = 2

while x <= n /x:
  if number %x == 0:
    primeFact = x
    number /= x
  else: 
    x = x + 1
    
print (primeFact)
